GMY-Comp ("Gimme Comp")
===============================================================================
gmycomp is a toolkit for comparing mysql databases that aims to be free,
to-the-point and quick to pick up.

Dependencies
===============================================================================
Currently gmycomp depends completely on the following pre-existing tools:

- mysql (command line tool, comes with mysql, mamp, etc...)
- diff (GNU diffutils)

These tools must be available in your `$PATH` to function properly.
